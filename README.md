# Megaroster

## Day 3 Homework

Finish yesterday's homework, using my Megaroster as a base. Don't forget to keep the `students` array in sync.

### Bonus Credit

Fool around with Foundation and/or CSS to make it look nicer.

### Mega Bonus Credit

Add buttons to change the position of the student within the list. In other words, add "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

Persist the student data using `window.localStorage`.# hw3-megaroster
